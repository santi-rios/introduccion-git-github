Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the main branch. Now that you have a branch, it’s time to create a file and make your first commit!

What is a commit?: A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "About commits".

⌨️ Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes to the project such as adding/removing/renaming files and modifying file content. For this exercise, committing a change will be adding a new file to your new branch.

Note

.md is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "Basic writing and formatting syntax" in our docs or by taking the "Communicating using Markdown" Skills Exercise.

    On the < > Code tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch my-first-branch.

    Select the Add file drop-down and click Create new file.



Click Commit changes... in the upper right corner above the contents box. A dialog will appear.

GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. Enter Add PROFILE.md in the Commit message field.

    A commit message and optional extended description help provide clarity for your changes. This is particularly useful when your commit involves several files.



In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields for now and click Commit changes.

Now that you've changed a file, Mona should already be busy checking your work. Give her a moment and keep watch in the comments. You will see her respond with progress info and the next lesson.
