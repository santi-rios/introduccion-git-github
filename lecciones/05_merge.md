What is a merge?: A merge adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch. For more information about merges, see "Merging a pull request."

⌨️ Activity: Merge the pull request

    Click Merge pull request.

        Note: You may see workflows running on your new pull request, causing the merge button to be inactive. Just wait a moment for them to finish and the merge button will activate.

    Click Confirm merge.

        Tip: Did you notice this dialog looks similar to adding a file? A merge is also a kind of commit!

    Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore. To delete this branch, click Delete branch.
